# 1.4 - CPU Idle Time

## Instructions
 - Record the Idle Time percentage in at least each of the following situations:
	* while as few applications as possible are running,
	* while the applications you typically have open are running,
	* while opening a few applications at the same time (try to target larger applications with longer startup times, like Microsoft Word or Excel, a game, or an image manipulation program such as Gimp or Photoshop),
	* and while running many applications at once (try 10–20).
## Answer

1. 1 App & 73 Background Processes = 2% @ 4.53 GHz 
2. 6 Apps & 75 Background Processes = 29% @ 4.50 GHz 
3. 31 Apps & 92 Background Processes = 100% @ 4.70 GHz (Max turbo clock speed)

4. With no applications open, a computer’s CPU will constantly spend its time waiting for any user input, sitting idle around 0% usage. When a few apps are opened, the CPU still spends most of its time waiting, but allocates some of its time processing the applications. When a lot of apps are open, the usage spikes up to around 100% and the CPU spends almost no time waiting for instructions. Also, when the CPU reaches a certain percentage of usage, its clock speed jumps from the base speed (set in the BIOS) up to speeds as high as the max turbo speed (On this processor, it’s 4.7 GHz).
