# Mad Libs Reflection
- Scratch was easier because it uses blocks and you don’t have to worry about syntax, while Python is a
typed language with actual syntax, which was a bit harder.
- Scratch is good for beginners because it's like building with blocks. Python gives more control but needs
more knowledge. Scratch is generally easier to start with.
- Scratch hides details, so it's easier. Python needs you to know more but can do more complex things.
- Due to me not being a beginner, I was more used to Python so it was easier, but if I were just beginning,
Scratch would most likely be way easier.
- Control and flexibility differs between Scratch and Python. In Scratch, it was easier to control simple
aspects of the project because the platform's visual blocks simplified the process. However, Python
offered greater control and flexibility, which could be useful for more complex projects. For Mad Libs,
where simplicity was sufficient, Scratch worked well.
- Debugging was easier in Scratch because you can see the blocks, making it simple to spot mistakes. In
Python, I used print statements and error messages, which needed a bit more effort but taught me better
debugging skills.
- Python forces organized coding. Scratch is more relaxed, but Python is better for organized projects.
- There were no big performance differences for Mad Libs. Python can be faster for complex stuff, but
Scratch might slow down with big projects.
- Due to me being used to Python, I will probably use it more even though Scratch is easier.
- Scratch was creative with pictures and sounds. Python is a little bit more difficult for visuals and creativity
because most of the time you will have to learn all about a new module.
- Python has more resources. Scratch is great for teaching. Both have plenty of help online.
- Knowing both helps problem-solving. Python is used in many fields. Scratch can be used in teaching and
learning.
- For beginners, Scratch is better, and Python is for those who want to continue learning. Overall, Python is
harder to learn.
- I preferred using Python because I taught myself how to create things with it and I’ve always enjoyed its
features.
