# AP Computer Science Principles
Welcome! This repo will have all of the assignments I completed in my course of AP CSP!

The course focused mostly on Python, but I have gone through each program and rewritten it in C# so I can easily convert it to an EXE for ease of use in case anyone wants to try them out!

To try out the programs I wrote, check out [RELEASES](https://github.com/GraysonHuey/AP-CSP-Assignments/releases/latest)

Any text documents I submitted, I have converted to Markdown to make it easy to read.
